Firefox
=======

Extensions
----------

I use the extensions listed [here](https://www.privacytools.io/#addons)
Specifically, they are:
* [privacy badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger/)
* [ublock origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
* [cookie autodelete](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/)
* [https everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/)
* [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)

Other stuff
-----------

I also use a Yubikey U2F which requires `security.webauth.u2f` to be set to
`true` in `about:config` (if firefox doesn't see the yubikey you might need to
play with `ykman` or the [Yubico test site](https://demo.yubico.com/u2f) to get
it working).
